Commands
	DDL: Create,Alter,truncate,Drop
	DML: Insert,Update,Delete,Select	
	TCL : Commit,Rollback
	DCL :

*Names given to columns or Objects are case insensitive

.A referential integrity constraint can be done using foreign key
.Data Dictionary is called as metadata

*VARCHAR2 is used unless we know the fixed size of characters  (Dynamic length)
Varchar --> Static length

*Composite primary key is created as table level constraint

*Only primary key or unique key columns in parent table is used as foreign key in child table

*data in foreign key can be duplicated and also can be null in some cases

*ALTER : ADD(CONSTRAINT),DROP,MODIFY,RENAME,

*Primary and unique key columns cannot be removed

*Constraint name start as SYS_C if we dont mention any constraint name

*DISABLING CONSTRIANT

*(DDL)RENAME TABLENAME TO NEWTABLE NAME;

*After every DML command we use a COMMIT statement

*DDL are auto-commited
*NuLL is the default value.


CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name
START WITH initial_value
INCREMENT BY increment_value
MINVALUE minimum value
MAXVALUE maximum value
CYCLE|NOCYCLE ;

sequence_name: Name of the sequence.

initial_value: starting value from where the sequence starts. 
Initial_value should be greater than or equal 
to minimum value and less than equal to maximum value.

increment_value: Value by which sequence will increment itself. 
Increment_value can be positive or negative.

minimum_value: Minimum value of the sequence.
maximum_value: Maximum value of the sequence.

cycle: When sequence reaches its set_limit 
it starts from beginning.

nocycle: An exception will be thrown 
if sequence exceeds its max_value.

nocache: number of values of the sequence the database preallocates 
By default 20 sequences are created

CURRVAL: returns the current value of the sequence.
NEXTVAL : increments and returns the new value

EX: SELECT Firstseq.CURRVAL from DUAL;  (DUAL IS SUMMY TABLE)

VALUES ->>>values

SET-->> UPDATE
